# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using JavaScript

## 2. Start with the Basics of DSA

### Understand the Fundamental Concepts:

#### Big-O Notation:

- Learn about time and space complexity.
- Analyze simple operations and loops for complexity.

#### Basic Data Structures:

- **Arrays** and **Strings** (native in JavaScript).
- Operations like traversal, insertion, and deletion.

## 3. Master Data Structures

Learn and implement the following data structures in JavaScript:

### Arrays

- **Two-pointer techniques**
- **Sliding window technique**
- Example Problems: Maximum Subarray, Two Sum

### Strings

- **String manipulation techniques**.
- Example Problems: Anagrams, Palindrome Checking

### Linked Lists

- Types: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List.
- Operations: Insert, Delete, Reverse, Detect Cycle.

### Stacks and Queues

- Use arrays or custom classes to implement.
- Applications: Balancing Parentheses, Next Greater Element.

### Hash Tables / Maps

- Implement custom hash maps and learn about collisions.
- Use JavaScript objects and `Map` for practice.
- Example Problems: Two Sum, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.

### Trees

- Types: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, N-ary Trees.
- Traversals: In-order, Pre-order, Post-order, Level-order.
- Problems: Maximum Depth, Validate BST.

### Graphs

- Representations: Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix.
- Traversals: BFS, DFS.
- Problems: Shortest Path (Dijkstra), Connected Components.

### Heaps

- Min-Heap and Max-Heap implementation using arrays.
- Applications: Priority Queues, Kth Largest Element.

### Tries (Prefix Trees)

- Insert and search operations.
- Applications: Auto-complete, Word Search.

## 4. Learn Core Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- Understand time complexities and when to use each.

### Searching Algorithms

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Search in Rotated Sorted Array

### Recursion

- Base cases, recursive calls.
- Problems: Fibonacci Sequence, Factorial, Subsets.

### Dynamic Programming (DP)

- Bottom-up and Top-down approaches.
- Problems: Longest Common Subsequence, Knapsack, Climbing Stairs.

### Greedy Algorithms

- Problems: Activity Selection, Huffman Encoding.

### Graph Algorithms

- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
- Kruskal’s and Prim’s for Minimum Spanning Tree

## 5. Practice Problem-Solving

### Use Platforms Like:

- **LeetCode**
- **HackerRank**
- **CodeSignal**
- **GeeksforGeeks**
- **Codeforces**

### Focus on Problem Categories:

- **Easy**: Arrays, Strings, Hashing.
- **Medium**: Trees, Backtracking, Sliding Window.
- **Hard**: Dynamic Programming, Advanced Graphs.

### Set Goals for Solving Problems Daily:

- **Easy**: 3-5 problems/day.
- **Medium**: 2-3 problems/day.
- **Hard**: 1 problem every 2 days.

## 6. Build Projects

### Apply DSA Concepts in Projects to Reinforce Learning:

- **Autocomplete feature** using Tries.
- **Pathfinding visualizer** using BFS/DFS.
- **E-commerce search and filter** using sorting and hashing.
